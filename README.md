## Introduction

This repository is for the repository project of a Informatics Capstone Project. The goal of this prototype is to allow patients find low-cost or free health events and cheap insurance/alternative healthcare plans. Moreover, on the side of clinicians and those who offer cheap alternatives to healthcare, they can upload their own events after going through a verification process within our system that garuntees that the events are real.
